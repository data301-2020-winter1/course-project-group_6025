## Milestones

Details for Milestone are available on Canvas (left sidebar, Course Project) or [here](https://firas.moosvi.com/courses/data301/project/milestone01.html).

## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Our topic is looking at a dataset pulled from Kaggle. It contains opening defenses in chess as well as other variables within a match. We want to analyze which of these strategies and other variables can best correlate with each other. We chose this topic because of a shared interest in chess from all members of our group. By the end of the project we hope to have a clear idea if there are any correlations of opening moves and wins, or other variables, that are associated with wins within a chess match.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set contains 20000 rows that assess approximately 13 variables in chess that may or may not correlate with chess wins and eachother. We want to assess which moves or variables best correlate to other variables within a chess match, specifically to see if any correlate with match wins. This dataset was obtained from Kaggle which pulled the data off of an online chess platform called Lichess. Although the length of time this data was accumulated for is unknown, it was last updated 3 years ago.
